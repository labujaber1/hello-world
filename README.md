# hello-world
Test repository for c lang programs produced in conjunction with comp science degree.
The programs are stored in .c files with an overall menu and submenu design.
The programs are stupid, simple and very novice. The purpose is to practice organising personal files
with the eventual intention of making it run as a desktop app. This can then be expanded to contain all personal files associated with each module in the course, both in research and submitted work. The repository used for this end target will be a private one.
